### Data
This dataset is from [CODEBASICS RESUME PROJECT CHALLENGE #7](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge/7) aimed at providing insights to executive management in the Consumer Goods domain. The project analyzes consumer behavior, product sales, and performance metrics using MySQL to generate actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

### Domain: Consumer Goods

### Function: Executive Management

### Problem Statement:

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too. However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

## Database Overview: (Atliq Hardware)

This project involves analyzing consumer data from the `gdb023` database, containing information related to product sales, manufacturing costs, and customer data. Below is an overview of the key tables and their descriptions.
